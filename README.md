# Frontend Mentor - Order summary

[Live site](https://optimistic-lumiere-7ede62.netlify.app/)

In this project I will create a component used to visually represent the process of completing an order, changing it of cancelling it.

This project is built with basic HTML and CSS, I will be using the BEM methodology to have a better structure in the stylesheets file.

## Known issues

- There's no space between the bottom of the page and the component itself.
- There are some accessibility and HTML issues.
